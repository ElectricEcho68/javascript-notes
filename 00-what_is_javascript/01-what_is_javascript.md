# what is javascript?

JavaScript (JS), born in 1995, is a versatile scripting language crucial for web development. It enables interactive webpages with animations, buttons, and menus. JS is known for front-end enhancements but also extends to server-side tasks with Node.js, managing data, requests, and databases. This dual capability makes JavaScript a comprehensive solution for web development.

Beyond websites, JavaScript is a key player in mobile app development through React Native. Developers use JS skills to build apps for both iOS and Android, streamlining the process and creating responsive experiences. JavaScript's reach expands further into desktop app development with Electron, seamlessly transforming web pages into standalone applications. This showcases JS's adaptability across web, mobile, and desktop domains.
